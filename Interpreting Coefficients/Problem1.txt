expenditure -- annual spending on recreation in US dollars
annual_income -- annual income in US dollars
have_kids -- dummy variable indicating families have children

I'm assuming annual_income2 is the square of the annual income.

Interpreting the coefficients and intercept
For eveery US dollar increase in annual income, the spending on recreation increases by 0.0012 dollars on average.  
For every US dollar increase in annual income the square of the spending on recreation increases by 0.00002 dollars on average.
Families with children, on average, spend $223.57 on recreation than families without children.
A family with no income and no children, on average, will spend $873 on recreation.

In order to make sure the coefficients make sense statistically, I would want to know the p values from t tests.
